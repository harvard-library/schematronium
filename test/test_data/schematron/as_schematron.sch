    <!-- eventually, this file should test for all of the ASpace "EAD" requirements prior to import
        (still need to figure what all of those are, including all undocumented data model constraints, etc.)

for the time being, i removed namespace checks so that the same rules will work for DTD and/or schema-associated files.

        still to add:
           something about field lengths (also need to test for length of title / unit ids, etc.)... if something is too long for the database, etc., like the 65k character limit :(
           what else???

        still to do:
           re-write the error messages!
           make sure that the error messages include everything needed
           pray that i can use xpath 2.0, as i've done here
           group and arrange this file like a semi-decent schematron file should actually be structured (and learn how to do that!)
